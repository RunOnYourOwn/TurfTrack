# Project Status

## Current Phase

- MVP complete: Core backend and frontend integration (weather, lawns, GDD models, analytics, deduplication, task monitoring)
- GDD calculation and reset logic fully implemented and tested
- Weather data deduplication and scheduled updates implemented
- Documentation and refactoring
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Full add/edit/delete functionality for products is now implemented in the frontend, using a reusable grouped ProductForm component, robust error handling, and modern UI/UX.
- **Security Hardening**: Implementing production-ready security measures including non-root user containers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Achieved 72% test coverage

## Completed Items

- Initial project structure
- Docker development environment
- Basic documentation framework
- Lawns CRUD UI (add, edit, delete, list) fully integrated with backend
- Axios refactor: all frontend API requests now use Axios and a generic fetcher utility
- React Query integration for all data fetching and caching
- Weather data ingestion and deduplication (no duplicate fetches for same location)
- Celery Beat and Worker setup for scheduled and manual weather updates
- Logging for weather data fetch logic and deduplication
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Robust weather data upsert with atomic operations
- Fixed race conditions in weather data updates
- Implemented proper error handling for weather tasks
- Added TaskStatus tracking to GDD recalculation Celery task
- GDD models feature complete with:
  - Model management (create, edit, delete)
  - Accurate GDD calculations with proper reset handling
  - Manual and automatic threshold resets
  - Run-based cumulative GDD tracking
  - Visual analytics and graphing
  - Proper date handling for resets and runs
- Task monitoring for weather and GDD recalculation jobs
- MVP achieved: System is robust, user-friendly, and production-ready
- Products CRUD UI complete with grouped nutrient fields
- **Database Performance Optimization:**
  - Fixed N+1 query problem in applications endpoint using `selectinload`
  - Added comprehensive database indexes across all major tables:
    - Applications: `application_date` and `status` indexes
    - GDD Values: `date` index for calculation performance
    - GDD Resets: `reset_date` index for reset processing
    - GDD Model Parameters: `effective_from` index for parameter history
    - Task Status: `started_at` and `status` indexes for monitoring
  - All indexes confirmed to be used by PostgreSQL query planner
  - Expected 5-50x performance improvement for date range and filtering queries
- **Security Hardening - Non-Root User Implementation:**
  - **Phase 1 Complete**: Backend API containers (dev & prod) now run as non-root user `api` (UID 1001)
  - **Phase 2 Complete**: Celery worker and beat containers run as non-root user `celery` (UID 1002)
  - **Phase 3 Complete**: Frontend containers (dev & prod) run as non-root user `frontend` (UID 1004)
  - **Phase 4 Complete**: Integration testing in development environment verified
  - All containers can write to required directories (`/app/logs`, `/app/data`, `/tmp`)
  - API endpoints, health checks, database migrations, and Celery tasks all work correctly
  - Frontend application accessible and functional at http://localhost:5173/
- **Comprehensive Testing - ✅ COMPLETE:**
  - **Test Infrastructure Setup**: Complete pytest configuration with coverage, async support, and custom markers
  - **Test Dependencies**: Added pytest-cov, pytest-mock, factory-boy, and httpx for comprehensive testing
  - **Test Configuration**: Created pytest.ini with coverage settings, test discovery, and custom markers
  - **Test Fixtures**: Comprehensive fixtures for database sessions, mock Redis/Celery, and sample data
  - **Test Utilities**: Factory classes and utility functions for creating test data and assertions
  - **Test Scripts**: Created run_tests.sh script for easy test execution with different options
  - **Test Structure**: Organized test directory with unit, integration, and e2e test packages
  - **Infrastructure Tests**: Created basic tests to verify test infrastructure is working correctly
  - **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all core modules, schemas, and utility functions
  - **Schema Validation Tests**: Complete validation testing for all Pydantic schemas with edge cases
  - **Core Module Tests**: 100% coverage for version.py, health.py, and database.py modules
  - **Utility Function Tests**: Extensive testing of application, GDD, location, and weather utilities
  - **Test Coverage**: Achieved 72% overall coverage with 100% coverage in core modules and schemas
  - **Test Quality**: All tests pass consistently with proper mocking and error handling

## In Progress

- Advanced analytics and reporting (future)
- More frontend features and polish (future)
- **Security Hardening**: Production container testing and final validation

## Next Steps

1. Monitor daily weather and GDD recalculation for correctness
2. Test production containers with non-root user implementation
3. Add advanced analytics and reporting (future)
4. Continue frontend enhancements (future)

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete security hardening (production testing)
2. Complete advanced analytics features
3. Finalize backend and frontend integration
4. Prepare for production deployment

## Notes

- GDD models are user-defined per lawn, use location weather data, and support:
  - Custom base temp, units, start date
  - Threshold-based automatic resets
  - Manual resets with proper run handling
  - Historical data tracking and forecasting
- GDD values are stored in the database with:
  - Daily and cumulative values
  - Run-based segmentation
  - Proper reset handling
  - Forecast integration
- GDD data is deleted when a lawn is deleted and it's the last lawn for a location
- Task status API endpoints are now exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Weather data updates are now atomic and race-condition free
- UI is professional, modern, and matches the current palette
- Export functionality for GDD data is planned for the future
- Future enhancements (e.g., next_threshold_date, lawn_name columns) are documented in tasks and technical docs
- **Security**: All containers now run as non-root users with proper file permissions and directory ownership
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test infrastructure is now complete with 72% coverage, covering all core modules, schemas, and utility functions
