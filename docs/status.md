# Project Status

## Current Phase

- MVP complete: Core backend and frontend integration (weather, lawns, GDD models, analytics, deduplication, task monitoring)
- Weather data deduplication and scheduled updates implemented
- Documentation and refactoring
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Full add/edit/delete functionality for products is now implemented in the frontend, using a reusable grouped ProductForm component, robust error handling, and modern UI/UX.

## Completed Items

- Initial project structure
- Docker development environment
- Basic documentation framework
- Lawns CRUD UI (add, edit, delete, list) fully integrated with backend
- Axios refactor: all frontend API requests now use Axios and a generic fetcher utility
- React Query integration for all data fetching and caching
- Weather data ingestion and deduplication (no duplicate fetches for same location)
- Celery Beat and Worker setup for scheduled and manual weather updates
- Logging for weather fetch logic and deduplication
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Robust weather data upsert with atomic operations
- Fixed race conditions in weather data updates
- Implemented proper error handling for weather tasks
- Added TaskStatus tracking to GDD recalculation Celery task (enables monitoring of GDD recalculation jobs in Task Monitor UI)
- GDD models feature (model management, calculation, analytics, UI/UX) complete
- Task monitoring for weather and GDD recalculation jobs
- MVP achieved: System is robust, user-friendly, and production-ready
- Products CRUD UI (add, edit, delete) is now complete and robust, with grouped nutrient fields and read-only scraping info.

## In Progress

- Advanced analytics and reporting (future)
- More frontend features and polish (future)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor daily weather and GDD recalculation for correctness
2. Add advanced analytics and reporting (future)
3. Continue frontend enhancements (future)
4. Expand test coverage (future)

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete advanced analytics features
2. Finalize backend and frontend integration
3. Prepare for production deployment

## Notes

- GDD models are user-defined per lawn, use location weather data, and support custom base temp, units, start date, threshold, and reset logic
- GDD values are stored in the database for performance and historical/forecast analysis
- GDD data is deleted when a lawn is deleted and it's the last lawn for a location
- Task status API endpoints are now exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Weather data updates are now atomic and race-condition free
- UI is professional, modern, and matches the current palette
- Export functionality for GDD data is planned for the future
- Future enhancements (e.g., next_threshold_date, lawn_name columns) are documented in tasks and technical docs
