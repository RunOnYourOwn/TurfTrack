# Project Status

## Current Phase

- Core backend and frontend integration (weather, lawns, deduplication)
- Weather data deduplication and scheduled updates implemented
- Documentation and refactoring
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration

## Completed Items

- Initial project structure
- Docker development environment
- Basic documentation framework
- Lawns CRUD UI (add, edit, delete, list) fully integrated with backend
- Axios refactor: all frontend API requests now use Axios and a generic fetcher utility
- React Query integration for all data fetching and caching
- Weather data ingestion and deduplication (no duplicate fetches for same location)
- Celery Beat and Worker setup for scheduled and manual weather updates
- Logging for weather fetch logic and deduplication
- Task status API endpoints exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Robust weather data upsert with atomic operations
- Fixed race conditions in weather data updates
- Implemented proper error handling for weather tasks

## In Progress

- GDD calculation service (model management, calculation, storage, and UI/UX in progress)
- GDD data cleanup on lawn/location deletion
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- More frontend features and polish

## Next Steps

1. Implement GDD calculations, model management, and UI
2. Add GDD graphing (cumulative line, daily bar, forecast distinction)
3. Add advanced analytics and reporting
4. Continue frontend enhancements
5. Expand test coverage

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Upcoming Milestones

1. Complete GDD and analytics features
2. Finalize backend and frontend integration
3. Prepare for production deployment

## Notes

- Weather data is now robustly deduplicated and scheduled for daily updates
- System is ready for further analytics and user-facing features
- Task status API endpoints are now exposed and ready for frontend integration
- Weather data updates are now atomic and race-condition free
- GDD models are user-defined per lawn, use location weather data, and support custom base temp, units, start date, threshold, and reset logic
- GDD values are stored in the database for performance and historical/forecast analysis
- GDD data is deleted when a lawn is deleted and it's the last lawn for a location
- UI will be professional, modern, and match the current palette
- Export functionality for GDD data is planned for the future
