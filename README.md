## ‚ö° Quickstart

Getting TurfTrack running on your local machine is simple.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RunOnYourOwn/TurfTrack.git
cd TurfTrack
```

### 2. Run the Application

This single command downloads the pre-built Docker images and starts all services.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.standalone.yml up -d
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

If you want to contribute to the code, follow these steps.

### 1. Environment Setup

- Copy the example environment file:
  ```bash
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
- **(Optional)** Fill in any required values in `.env` if you are not using the default Docker setup.

### 2. Start the Development Environment

This command mounts your local source code into the containers and enables hot-reloading for both the frontend and backend.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d
```

- Frontend (with hot-reloading): [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Backend API Docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

---

## üß™ Testing

To run the backend test suite:

```bash
cd backend
./run_tests.sh
```

## Container Images & Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and publish versioned Docker images to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). See `docker-compose.standalone.yml` for an example of how to use them.

### Image Versioning

Three separate images are published: `turftrack-backend`, `turftrack-celery`, and `turftrack-frontend`. The following tagging strategy is used:

- `:latest`: For every push to the `main` branch, images are tagged with `:latest`. This tag represents the most recent development build.
- `:sha-xxxxxxx`: Every commit-specific image is tagged with its short git SHA (e.g., `:cb758e7`).
- `:<version>`: When a formal release is created, images are tagged with the corresponding semantic version number (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

### Creating a Release

To create a new, versioned release (for maintainers):

1.  Ensure all your changes are on the `main` branch.
2.  Use the `version.sh` script to bump the version number. For example, to create a patch release:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/version.sh release patch
    ```
3.  This will push a new version tag to GitHub, which triggers the `Release` workflow.
4.  The workflow will test, build, and publish the images, and create a draft release on GitHub.
5.  Go to the GitHub Releases page to review and publish the draft.
